# Predicting-Chronic-Kidney-Disease
The goal of this project is to analyze medical diagnostic data and predict whether a patient has Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using Apache Spark (PySpark). The project focuses on identifying key clinical factors associated with CKD and building a Decision Tree Classification Model to classify patients into either CKD or Not CKD categories.
